## Customization

Some design aspects of the visualizations, such as the font-size of the tick labels, the color of the title, the color of the axes, etc. are **controlled by CSS**.
We provide sane defaults that should be sufficient to start with, but at some point
you might like to tweak a few things so the visualizations integrate better with your app's design.

### Inherited font properties

Font properties (`font-size`, `font-family`, etc.) of textual elements (tick labels, plot title, etc.) are **inherited by default**, so tweaking them all at once is easy.
Story <LinkTo kind="Building Blocks/VisCanvas" story="Inherited Styles">_Inherited Styles_</LinkTo> demonstrates this technique. For instance, if you'd like to change the font-size and font-family of the `LineVis`, here is what you could do:

```tsx
<div className="my-container">
  <LineVis {...props} />
</div>
```

```css
.my-container {
  font-family: monospace;
  font-size: 90%;
}
```

### CSS custom properties

For more advanced customization, the library exposes a number of CSS custom properties, which you may use
as you see fit. For instance, if you'd like to change the color of the curve of the `LineVis`, here is what you could do:

```tsx
<div className="my-container">
  <LineVis {...props} />
</div>
```

```css
.my-container {
  --h5w-line--curveColor: teal;
}

/* If you want every `LineVis` in your app to have the same curve color, you could even use `:root` */
:root {
  --h5w-line--curveColor: teal;
}
```

#### LineVis

| Name                   | Default          | Description                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| --h5w-line--curveColor | 'midnightblue'   | Color of the main curve and error bars/caps |
| --h5w-line--auxColor   | 'cornflowerblue' | Color of the auxiliary curves               |
