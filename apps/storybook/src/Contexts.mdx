## VisCanvasContext

Children of `VisCanvas` have access to `VisCanvasContext`, which provides helpful utilities, notably to convert points between coordinate spaces (data, world, HTML).
It also exposes the size and ratio of the canvas and of the visualization, as well as the axis configs passed to `VisCanvas`.

Consumers of `VisCanvasContext` re-render **every time the size of the canvas changes**.

```ts
useVisCanvasContext(): VisCanvasContextValue

const { visSize, dataToWorld, worldToData } = useVisCanvasContext();
```

`VisCanvasContext` also exposes a number of DOM elements that can be used for [advanced use cases](https://h5web-docs.panosc.eu/?path=/story/building-blocks-html--portal):

| Name         | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `visCanvas`  | Root `div` rendered by `VisCanvas` to delimit the area of the visualization (axes included) |
| `canvasArea` | Container that delimits the area available to the WebGL canvas                              |
| `r3fRoot`    | React Three Fiber container rendered inside `canvasArea` that wraps the `canvas` element    |

> These tables are not exhaustive. Please consider any undocumented property as experimental or meant for internal use only.

## InteractionsContext

Children of `VisCanvas` also have access to `InteractionsContext`, which provides low-level utilities for coordinating mouse interactivity on the canvas.
However, thanks to the `useInteraction` hook, which allows registering new interactions, there's little need to access `InteractionsContext` directly.

The only utility you may need is `getInteractions`, which allows accessing all registered interactions that are currently enabled. If you pass mouse button(s)
and/or modifier key(s) to it, it can filter the interactions and return only those that are compatible. Note that `getInteractions` only works
when called inside an event handler, not during render.

```ts
getInteractions: (
  button?: InteractionConfig['button'],
  modifierKey?: InteractionConfig['modifierKey'],
) => Interaction[];
```
